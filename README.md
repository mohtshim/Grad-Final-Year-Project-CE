# Final Year Project
## Embedded Based Monitoring System Through DNNs
### Description
This project was made as a final year graduation project in which I build a monitoring system that comprises the different DNNs and runs on the resource constraint device like raspberry pi in such a way that our monitoring system gives fps and also gives us the required output.

For the validation of this project, we choose the face mask detector and face recognition system and combine them. Those who are not wearing a mask get detected and recognized and after that recognized person screenshot is emailed to the required authorities.
### Problems
Problems in this project that we usually face whenever we run a DNN on the resource constraint device are as follows.
1) Frame per second.
2) How do you tackle double detection of the same person?
3) What if the same person comes after some interval of time?
4) Which modules need to be run constantly? Face-mask detector or Face-recognition detector?
### Solution
The solution is as follows.
